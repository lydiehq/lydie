This enables features like version control for your content, collaborative editing through pull requests, automatic backups, code review workflows for documentation, branch-based content staging, and seamless integration with your existing development workflow. GitHub offers a generous Free Plan for individuals and organizations, with paid plans that scale from personal projects to enterprise teams.\n\n## Instructions\n\n### Connecting GitHub\n\nThere are two ways to connect GitHub:\n\n**GitHub App Installation (Recommended)**: Installs the Lydie GitHub App and grants access to your repositories. You can select which repositories to sync with, and manage permissions through GitHub's app settings.
