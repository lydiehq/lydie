    a: "The AI can analyze your documents, suggest logical categorization schemes, help you move documents to appropriate locations, and maintain an organized knowledge base. It understands document content and relationships, making intelligent suggestions about where documents should be filed and how they should be structured.",
  },
  {
    q: "Can the AI automatically organize my documents?",
    a: "The AI assists with organization but doesn't automatically reorganize without your input. You can ask it to suggest organization schemes, recommend where specific documents should go, or help move multiple documents at once. This ensures you maintain control while benefiting from AI-powered assistance.",
  },
  {
    q: "Can I ask the AI to create new folders or restructure my workspace?",
    a: "Yes! You can describe your desired organization structure, and the AI can help implement it by moving documents, suggesting new folder hierarchies, and helping you maintain consistency. Whether you want to organize by project, topic, date, or any other scheme, the AI adapts to your needs.",

        <h2>Intelligent Knowledge Management</h2>
        <p class="">
          As your knowledge base grows, keeping everything organized becomes
          challenging. Lydie's AI document organization assistant helps you
          maintain a clean, logical structure by analyzing document content,
          understanding relationships between documents, and suggesting
          intelligent organization schemes tailored to your workflow.
        </p>
        <p class="">
          Ask the AI to help organize documents by topic, project, date, or any
          other criteria. It can move multiple documents at once, suggest folder
          structures that make sense for your content, and help you maintain
          consistency across your workspace. The AI understands what's in your
          documents and can categorize them intelligently based on content, not
          just file names.
        </p>

        <h2>Smart Document Categorization</h2>
        <p class="">
          The AI analyzes your documents to understand their content, purpose,
          and relationships. It can identify themes, recognize project
          associations, and suggest logical groupings that align with how you
          actually work. Whether you're managing a personal knowledge base or
          organizing team documentation, the AI adapts to your specific needs
          and preferences.
        </p>
        <p class="">
          You can ask natural language questions like "organize all my meeting
          notes from last month" or "move all documents about project X to their
          own folder," and the AI will handle the details while keeping you in
          control of the final decisions.
        </p>

        <h2>Maintain Organization Over Time</h2>
        <p class="">
          Beyond initial organization, the AI helps you maintain a clean
          workspace as you create new content. It can suggest where new
          documents should go based on their content, identify documents that
          might be in the wrong place, and help you evolve your organization
          structure as your needs change.
        </p>
        <p class="">
          Perfect for knowledge workers, project managers, researchers, and
          anyone managing a large collection of documents who wants to spend
          less time organizing and more time creating.
