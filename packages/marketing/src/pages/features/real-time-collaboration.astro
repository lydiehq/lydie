        Google Docs. It allows multiple people to work on the same document at
        the same time, making it easy to write, review, and improve content
        together. Changes appear instantly, so everyone stays aligned without
        worrying about outdated versions or duplicate files.

        Real-time collaboration in Lydie is designed to feel simple and
        predictable. You can see edits as they happen, understand who is working
        where, and focus on the content instead of managing files. Whether
        you're drafting documentation, writing blog posts, or maintaining shared
        notes, Lydie makes collaborative writing online feel effortless.

      </h3>

      <p class="text-[15px]/relaxed text-gray-600 max-w-2xl">
        Lydie goes beyond traditional document collaboration. With integrations
        for platforms like GitHub, WordPress, and Shopify, teams can
        collaboratively edit content directly on the web. This makes Lydie a
        Google Docs–like editor built for modern workflows, where writing and
        publishing are closely connected.
