      <h2>About AI Document Formatter</h2>
      <p>
        Our free AI document formatter helps you transform messy notes, rough
        drafts, and unformatted text into beautifully structured documents.
        Whether you need professional reports, academic essays, casual blog
        posts, or highly organized reference materials, this tool adapts to your
        needs.
      </p>

      <h3>How to Use This Tool Effectively</h3>
      <p>
        While AI can quickly format your documents, the best results come from
        understanding your options and using them intentionally:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Choose the right output format:</strong> Use Markdown for maximum
          compatibility with writing apps, HTML for web publishing, and Plain Text
          for simple text editors.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Match style to purpose:</strong> Professional style works best for
          business documents and reports. Academic style is ideal for research papers.
          Casual style suits blog posts and newsletters. Structured style creates
          highly scannable reference documents.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Review and refine:</strong> The AI creates a great starting point,
          but you should always review the output and make it your own. Add your voice,
          adjust headings, and customize as needed.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Why Format Documents?</h3>
      <p>
        Well-formatted documents are easier to read, more professional in
        appearance, and more accessible to diverse audiences. Good formatting
        creates visual hierarchy that guides readers through your content,
        emphasizes key points, and improves comprehension. Whether you're
        sharing with colleagues, publishing online, or submitting for academic
        review, proper formatting makes your content shine.
