      <h3>Understanding the Statistics</h3>
      <p>
        <strong>Reading Time:</strong> Based on 225 words per minute, which is the
        average comfortable reading speed for adults. Silent reading speeds vary from
        200-300 WPM depending on text complexity and reader experience.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Speaking Time:</strong> Calculated at 140 words per minute, the average
        conversational speaking pace. Professional speakers and podcasters often aim
        for 140-160 WPM for clarity and engagement.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Average Word Length:</strong> English averages about 4.7 characters
        per word. Longer words can indicate more complex or technical writing, while
        shorter words typically improve readability.
