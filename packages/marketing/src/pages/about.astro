        Lydie was created with the philosophy of making writing less scattered
        around the web in small neglected WYSIWYG editors.
        <br />
        <br />
        I myself used to run a Shopify store and was frustrated with the in-platform
        content editor used for blogging, so I had a vision of creating a platform
        which would offer a delightful writing experience, and which would connect
        effortlessly to other platforms - such as my Shopify store!
        <br />
        <br />
        I&apos;ve spent many years writing content for different things, and thus
        used many different platforms and tools for writing, but I&apos;ve never found
        a tool that truly resonated with me in terms of UX and features - Lydie is
        my attempt to create a tool that checks the boxes on these things, and I see
        a lot of potential for the platform.
        <br />
        <br />
        I&apos;m currently just a single developer, designer and marketer on the project,
        which is in its early stages, but I am incredibly excited to wake up every
        day, being able to work on something I am passionate about. I am eager to
        hear support and ideas, so feel free to reach out on Twitter or Email! On
        top of that, I am maintaining a roadmap of upcoming features, which you can
        check out <a
