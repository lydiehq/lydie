  {
    q: "What is a personal knowledge base?",
    a: "A personal knowledge base is your private repository of information, ideas, and expertise. It's where you capture what you learn, document your thoughts, and organize knowledge in a way that makes sense to you. Think of it as your second brain—a place to offload information so you can focus on thinking and creating. Unlike simple note-taking apps, a knowledge base helps you build connections between ideas over time.",
  },
  {
    q: "How do I organize my personal knowledge base?",
    a: "Start with broad categories that reflect your life and interests—work projects, learning notes, personal goals, hobbies. Use nested pages to drill down into specifics. Link related notes together to create connections. The key is to organize by action and context rather than just topic, so you can find what you need when you need it. Lydie makes it easy to reorganize as your system evolves.",
  },
  {
    q: "How do you create a personal knowledge base?",
    a: "Creating a personal knowledge base starts with choosing the right tool. Start small—create a few main categories that reflect your interests and work. Capture everything you want to remember: notes from meetings, book summaries, project ideas, and insights. The most important habit is consistent capture. Don't worry about perfect organization at first; you can always reorganize as patterns emerge. Link related notes together to build a web of connected knowledge.",
  },
  {
    q: "Can I access my knowledge base across devices?",
    a: "Yes! Lydie syncs your knowledge base across all your devices—desktop, tablet, and mobile. Start writing on your laptop at work, review on your phone during your commute, and expand on ideas from your tablet at home. Everything stays in sync automatically. Whether you use our web app, desktop app, or mobile app, your knowledge is always available.",
  },
  {
    q: "What types of content can I store in my knowledge base?",
    a: "Anything you want to remember or reference later: meeting notes, book summaries, project ideas, research findings, journal entries, goals and plans, code snippets, inspiration, and more. Lydie supports rich text, images, code blocks, and embeds so you can capture information in whatever format works best. Your knowledge base becomes a rich repository of everything you learn.",
  },
  {
    q: "How is this different from note-taking apps?",
    a: "Traditional note-taking apps are often just digital filing cabinets. A knowledge base is designed for connection and retrieval—you link ideas together, resurface relevant information when you need it, and build knowledge over time. It's not just storage; it's a thinking tool that helps you make sense of what you know. With features like internal linking, powerful search, and AI assistance, Lydie goes far beyond simple note-taking.",
  },
  {
    q: "What are the best personal knowledge base apps?",
    a: "The best personal knowledge base apps combine powerful organization, easy capture, and intelligent features. Lydie stands out with its ergonomic editor, AI-powered assistance, and seamless internal linking. While tools like Notion offer templates for knowledge bases, Lydie is purpose-built for deep thinking and knowledge management. We focus on making the writing experience delightful while providing powerful tools to organize and connect your ideas.",
  },
  {
    q: "Is there a free personal knowledge base software option?",
    a: "Yes! Lydie offers a generous free tier so you can start building your personal knowledge base without any cost. The free plan includes unlimited pages, powerful search, and core organization features. As your knowledge base grows, you can upgrade to access AI features and advanced capabilities. We're committed to making knowledge management accessible to everyone.",
  },
  {
    q: "How does AI help with a personal knowledge base?",
    a: "AI transforms how you interact with your knowledge base. Lydie's AI assistant can help summarize long notes, suggest connections between related ideas, expand on concepts you're developing, and even help you reorganize content. It's like having a research assistant that knows everything you've written. The AI personal knowledge base approach helps you discover insights you might have missed and accelerates your learning.",
