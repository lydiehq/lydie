    q: "What is a personal knowledge base?",
    a: "A personal knowledge base is where you keep your private notes, ideas, and information. You capture what you learn and organize it in a way that makes sense to you. It helps you offload information so you can focus on thinking and creating. You can also build connections between related ideas over time.",
  },
  {
    q: "How do I organize my personal knowledge base?",
    a: "Start with broad categories that reflect your life and interests: work projects, learning notes, personal goals, hobbies. Use nested pages to go deeper into specifics. Link related notes together. Organize by action and context so you can find what you need when you need it. Lydie makes it easy to reorganize as your system evolves.",
  },
  {
    q: "Can I access my knowledge base across devices?",
    a: "Yes. Lydie syncs across all your devices: desktop, tablet, and mobile. Start writing on your laptop at work, review on your phone during your commute, and expand on ideas from your tablet at home. Everything stays in sync automatically. Your knowledge is always available.",
  },
  {
    q: "What types of content can I store in my knowledge base?",
    a: "Anything you want to remember or reference later: meeting notes, book summaries, project ideas, research findings, journal entries, goals and plans, code snippets, inspiration, and more. Lydie supports rich text, images, code blocks, and embeds. Capture information in whatever format works best.",
  },
  {
    q: "How does AI help with a personal knowledge base?",
    a: "AI changes how you interact with your knowledge base. Lydie's AI can summarize long notes, suggest connections between related ideas, expand on concepts you are developing, and help you reorganize content. It is like having a research assistant that knows everything you have written. AI helps you discover insights you might have missed.",
