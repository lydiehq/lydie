    q: "What is a company wiki?",
    a: "A company wiki is where your team stores and organizes information like processes, documentation, policies, meeting notes, and project specs. It is a single place where everyone can find what they need. This reduces information silos and helps people get the context they need to do their work.",
  },
  {
    q: "How does a company wiki help with onboarding?",
    a: "New team members can get up to speed faster when company knowledge is documented and easy to find. Instead of asking the same questions repeatedly, they can look up answers in the wiki. This includes company values, benefits info, technical documentation, and team processes. It reduces onboarding time and helps new hires feel more confident.",
  },
  {
    q: "Can different teams have their own wikis?",
    a: "Yes. You can maintain company-wide wikis for information like mission statements and goals. Individual teams can also create their own spaces. Engineering can have technical documentation. Marketing can store campaigns and brand guidelines. Product can maintain roadmaps and specs. Each team gets what they need while staying connected to the bigger picture.",
  },
  {
    q: "How do we keep our company wiki up to date?",
    a: "Lydie makes it easy to maintain current documentation. Assign owners to key pages. Use inline comments to suggest updates. Check version history to track changes. Regular reviews and treating docs with the same care as code help ensure your wiki stays useful.",
  },
  {
    q: "Is there a limit to how much we can store?",
    a: "There is no practical limit on how much content you can store. Create as many pages and databases as your team needs. Search and organization tools scale with your content, so you can always find what you need.",
  },

          When company information is in one place, everything becomes easier. Teams find what they need without digging through emails or chat. New hires get up to speed faster when processes are documented. Decisions get made with better information.

        <p class="fade-in-element" style="animation-delay: 0.5s;">
          Lydie wikis work for companies of any size. Build company-wide knowledge bases for information like goals and mission statements. Let individual teams create their own spaces for engineering docs, marketing playbooks, or product documentation.
        </p>
        <p class="fade-in-element" style="animation-delay: 0.6s;">
          Start with templates or build from scratch. Create databases for meeting notes, project docs, and shared resources. With search, linking between pages, and collaborative editing, your wiki becomes a living document that grows with your company.
